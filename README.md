# 🚀 AI Native Journey

Welcome to the `AI Native Journey` repository! This space is dedicated to exploring, experimenting with, and building projects in the exciting world of **Artificial Intelligence**. It's a personal journey of learning and discovery, focusing on developing **AI-native applications and solutions**.

## ✨ About This Repository

This repository serves as a hub for my ongoing exploration into various AI concepts, frameworks, and applications. Here, you'll find:

* **Code examples:** Implementations of different AI algorithms, models, and techniques.

* **Project showcases:** Small to medium-sized AI projects demonstrating practical applications.

* **Learning notes:** Summaries, insights, and challenges encountered during the learning process.

* **Experiments:** Sandboxes for trying out new ideas and cutting-edge AI tools.

The goal is to embrace an "AI-native" mindset, where AI isn't just an add-on, but a foundational element of the solutions being built.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Explored

As part of this journey, I'm diving into a variety of technologies and concepts. While this list will evolve, current areas of focus include:

* **Programming Languages:** Python (primary), JavaScript

* **AI Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn

* **Generative AI:** Large Language Models (LLMs), Image Generation, Multimodal AI

* **Machine Learning:** Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning

* **Tools & Platforms:** Hugging Face, OpenAI APIs, Google Cloud AI/Vertex AI

* **Key Concepts:** Prompt Engineering, Model Deployment, MLOps basics

## 🚀 Getting Started

To explore the code and projects within this repository, follow these general steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/AI_Native_Journey.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/AI_Native_Journey.git)
   cd AI_Native_Journey
   ```

2. **Set up your environment:**

   * It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

   * Install necessary dependencies (check individual `projects` or `notebooks` directories for specific `requirements.txt` files).

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt # If a global requirements file exists
   ```

3. **Run notebooks or projects:**

   * For Jupyter notebooks: `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook`

   * For individual Python scripts: `python projects/project-x/main.py` (refer to specific project instructions)
